## NEAR DA + OP Stack tutorial

If you're looking to run the OP Stack + NEAR DA setup for this repository, please visit the [NEAR DA guides](https://docs.near.org/data-availability/welcome) to get started.

## What are Optimism and the OP Stack?

Optimism is a low-cost and lightning-fast Ethereum L2 blockchain, **but it's also so much more than that**.

The OP Stack powers Optimism, an Ethereum L2 blockchain, and forms the technical foundation for the [the Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement)—a group committed to the **impact=profit** principle. This principle rewards individuals for their positive contributions to the collective.

Optimism addresses critical coordination failures in the crypto ecosystem, such as funding public goods and infrastructure. The OP Stack focuses on creating a shared, open-source system for developing new L2 blockchains within the proposed Superchain ecosystem, promoting collaboration and preventing redundant efforts.

As Optimism evolves, the OP Stack will adapt, encompassing components ranging from blockchain infrastructure to governance systems. This software suite aims to simplify L2 blockchain creation while supporting the growth and development of the Optimism ecosystem.

## What is NEAR?

NEAR is a decentralized application platform designed to improve scalability and user experience in blockchain technology.

Utilizing a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, it focuses on energy efficiency and high transaction throughput. NEAR’s standout feature is sharding, which breaks the network into smaller segments for parallel processing, greatly enhancing speed and capacity.

This approach makes NEAR particularly appealing for developers building decentralized applications and for users seeking fast, low-cost transactions, and also for data availability for Ethereum rollups.

## Bridging

If you have the OP Stack + NEAR DA setup running, you can test out bridging from the L1
to the L2.

To do this, first navigate to the `packages/contracts-bedrock` directory and create a
`.env` file with the following contents:

```bash
L1_PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:8545
L2_PROVIDER_URL=http://localhost:9545
PRIVATE_KEY=bf7604d9d3a1c7748642b1b7b05c2bd219c9faa91458b370f85e5a40f3b03af7
```

Then, run the following from the same directory:

```bash
npx hardhat deposit --network devnetL1 --l1-provider-url http://localhost:8545 --l2-provider-url http://localhost:9545 --amount-eth <AMOUNT> --to <ADDRESS>
```

## Branching Model

### Active Branches

| Branch          | Status                                                                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [master](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/)                   | Accepts PRs from `develop` when we intend to deploy to mainnet.                                      |
| [develop](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/)                 | Accepts PRs that are compatible with `master` OR from `release/X.X.X` branches.                    |
| release/X.X.X                                                                          | Accepts PRs for all changes, particularly those not backwards compatible with `develop` and `master`. |

### Overview

We generally follow [this Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Please read the linked post if you're planning to make frequent PRs into this repository (e.g., people working at/with Optimism).

### Production branch

Our production branch is `master`.
The `master` branch contains the code for our latest "stable" releases.
Updates from `master` **always** come from the `develop` branch.
We only ever update the `master` branch when we intend to deploy code within the `develop` to the Optimism mainnet.
Our update process takes the form of a PR merging the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.

### Development branch

Our primary development branch is [`develop`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/).
`develop` contains the most up-to-date software that remains backwards compatible with our latest experimental [network deployments](https://community.optimism.io/docs/useful-tools/networks/).
If you're making a backwards compatible change, please direct your pull request towards `develop`.

**Changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` are usually NOT considered backwards compatible and SHOULD be made against a release candidate branch**.
Some exceptions to this rule exist for cases in which we absolutely must deploy some new contract after a release candidate branch has already been fully deployed.
If you're changing or adding a contract and you're unsure about which branch to make a PR into, default to using the latest release candidate branch.
See below for info about release candidate branches.

### Release candidate branches

Branches marked `release/X.X.X` are **release candidate branches**.
Changes that are not backwards compatible and all changes to contracts within `packages/contracts/contracts` MUST be directed towards a release candidate branch.
Release candidates are merged into `develop` and then into `master` once they've been fully deployed.
We may sometimes have more than one active `release/X.X.X` branch if we're in the middle of a deployment.
See table in the **Active Branches** section above to find the right branch to target.

## Releases

### Changesets

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to mark packages for new releases.
When merging commits to the `develop` branch you MUST include a changeset file if your change would require that a new version of a package be released.

To add a changeset, run the command `yarn changeset` in the root of this monorepo.
You will be presented with a small prompt to select the packages to be released, the scope of the release (major, minor, or patch), and the reason for the release.
Comments within changeset files will be automatically included in the changelog of the package.

### Triggering Releases

Releases can be triggered using the following process:

1. Create a PR that merges the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.
2. Wait for the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR to be opened (may take several minutes).
3. Change the base branch of the auto-generated `Version Packages` PR from `master` to `develop` and merge into `develop`.
4. Create a second PR to merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch.

After merging the second PR into the `master` branch, packages will be automatically released to their respective locations according to the set of changeset files in the `develop` branch at the start of the process.
Please carry this process out exactly as listed to avoid `develop` and `master` falling out of sync.

**NOTE**: PRs containing changeset files merged into `develop` during the release process can cause issues with changesets that can require manual intervention to fix.
It's strongly recommended to avoid merging PRs into develop during an active release.
